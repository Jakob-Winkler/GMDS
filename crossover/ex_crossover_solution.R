# 1.1
# First, take a look at the function tssim, which we will use to simulate some data.
# There are a lot of parameters, you don't have to understand all of them (in the documentation the formulas for the simulations are given)
# Importantly the parameter beta1 controls the true treatment effect. 
# With exp(beta1) being the Hazard ratio (HR) between the two treatment arms
#
# What is the true HR?
# What are the output variables?

# Additionally, a dataset df_short is created - what are its variables?

exp(-0.4)


# 1.2 ITT

# Fit the survival time against the assigned treatment.
